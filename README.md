Hi 👋 I'm Necati Akpinar
===============================

Senior Game Developer | Full Stack Developer
---------------------

I am a full-stack game developer and a dedicated problem solver with strong communication skills. Over the years, I've been committed to advancing my professional skills through a system of continuous learning and development.

My backend expertise, particularly in .NET, allows me to design and implement scalable, robust server-side solutions that are essential for today’s data-driven applications. By leveraging these technologies, I can build systems that not only support but also elevate the user experience with reliable, well-optimized, and secure backend infrastructures.

In pursuit of my dreams, I founded a gaming start-up and successfully released a PC game. This accomplishment has fueled my ambition to continue building innovative solutions and honing my engineering skills within the gaming industry.

With expertise in multiple programming languages, including C#, C++, SQL, React, and Python, I excel at creating diverse solutions for complex challenges. My backend development skills are a cornerstone of my work, especially my proficiency in .NET and Java Spring, which further complement my experience in React Native, making me a well-rounded full-stack developer.

I have gained valuable experience working in both corporate and start-up environments, giving me a deep understanding of Agile methodologies. Additionally, I have a solid background in data warehousing and Business Intelligence, which has enhanced my ability to handle complex backend data processes and integrations effectively.
